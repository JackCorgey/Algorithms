##### If you're looking to find a string buried in a mountain of text, the Boore-Moore algorithm is your shovel.

#### Take for instance the following sequence of characters known as the haystach

##### The brute force approach would be to line the haystack and needle where the first index of the characters line up

###### rute forcebrute forcbrute force
